                <p>Our journey is a testament to our unwavering spirit and dedication; a legacy that began with our beloved founder, the late K S Thirupathi Raja. Early in life, he embarked on a journey far from home, honing his culinary skills in Chennai and Mumbai. From humble beginnings as a table cleaner, he went on to master the art of sweet-making. <br>

                  At one point, he had to return to Rajapalayam to take up farming on their ancestral property. All the hard work paid off  and success came knocking at his door. Soon, he made expansion plans. With borrowed funds and a heart full of hope, he leased adjacent farmlands expecting greater returns.</p>

                   <p>In the mid-1970s, he made the courageous decision to relocate to Bengaluru. With the unwavering support of his loving wife and two sons, who postponed their education to help run the shop, he founded Srinivasa Sweets.

                    His journey was defined by resilience and hard work. The family of four lived modestly, building their business brick by brick. Our founder crafted sweets, his wife assisted, and his two sons managed various aspects of the shop. Despite facing multiple challenges , their determination bore fruit, granting them a fresh start in Bengaluru.</p>
                   <p>Today, Adyar Ananda Bhavan is a 1200 crore plus turnover company with over 12,000 employees and global branches in the USA, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Canada and the UK. As we reflect on this remarkable journey, we proudly uphold the values that have guided us all the way- the importance of family and trust, the dedication to quality, and a commitment to giving back to society. Because this is what grew a small sweets stall to evolve into a global brand, that stands for authentic traditions.</p>
