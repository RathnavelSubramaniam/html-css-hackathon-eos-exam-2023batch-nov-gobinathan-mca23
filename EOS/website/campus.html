Our beloved founder Late Sri. KS Thirupathi Raja was a man of remarkable discipline, hard work, and indomitable will. Throughout his life, he battled hardships, but he was unfazed by them. He held onto a singular belief that "hard work eventually pays." That belief is now what we call Adyar Ananda Bhavan
